Javascript Frequency Filtering
==============================

This is a small web application that does some basic frequency domain filtering on images.

In the future I plan to come back to this and redo the fft algorithm so that it is performed using webgl instead of typed arrays. I'm also sure that the Dampened spectrum display could be computed far faster in webgl.
